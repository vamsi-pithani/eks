📝 Kubernetes Pods — Notes

# Kubernetes Pods — Notes
---
## 📌 What is a Pod?
- **Smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
- Represents **one or more containers** that share:
  - A **network namespace** (same IP and port space).
  - **Volumes** (shared storage).
- Typically runs **one container**, but can run multiple tightly coupled containers (sidecar pattern).

---

## 📌 Pod Structure
- **Pod Specification**:
  - Containers (images, commands, environment variables, ports).
  - Volumes.
  - Network configuration.
  - Resource requests and limits (CPU, memory).
- **Pod Manifest**:
  - YAML or JSON:
    - `apiVersion: v1`
    - `kind: Pod`
    - `metadata`, `spec`

---

## 📌 Pod Lifecycle
1. **Pending**: Pod accepted by Kubernetes but not yet scheduled on a node.
2. **Scheduled**: Pod assigned to a node.
3. **Running**: Pod is running on the node.
4. **Succeeded**: Pod completed successfully (for pods with restartPolicy: Never).
5. **Failed**: Pod terminated with failure (non-zero exit code).
6. **Unknown**: Node unreachable or state cannot be determined.

---

## 📌 Pod Restart Policies
- **Always** (default): Restart container on exit.
- **OnFailure**: Restart container only if it fails (non-zero exit code).
- **Never**: Never restart the container.

---

## 📌 Pod Networking
- Each Pod gets:
  - A **unique IP address** via the CNI plugin.
  - Containers in a Pod share the **same network namespace**:
    - Localhost communication between containers.
    - Same IP and port space.
- Pod communication:
  - Pod-to-Pod: direct Pod IP or via Services.
  - Pod-to-Service: DNS or ClusterIP.

---

## 📌 Pod Storage
- **Volumes**: Shared storage between containers in a Pod.
  - `emptyDir`: Temporary, deleted with Pod.
  - `hostPath`: Node’s filesystem.
  - `persistentVolumeClaim` (PVC): Connects to Persistent Volumes.

---

## 📌 Multi-Container Pods
- Use cases:
  - Sidecar containers (logging, monitoring, proxy).
  - Ambassador containers (API adapters).
  - Adapter containers - 
- Containers share:
  - Network namespace.
  - Volumes.

```

---

## 📌 Pod Health Checks
- **Liveness probe**: Is the app alive? (Restart if failing.)
- **Readiness probe**: Is the app ready to serve traffic?
- **Startup probe**: For slow-starting apps.

---

## 📌 Pod Labels & Selectors
- **Labels**: Key-value pairs to identify Pods (e.g. `app: frontend`).
- **Selectors**: Used by Services, ReplicaSets, Deployments to select Pods.

---

## 📌 Pod Annotations
- Non-identifying metadata (e.g. config, debug info).

---

## 📌 Pod Security Context
- Controls permissions inside the Pod:
  - `runAsUser`
  - `privileged`
  - `fsGroup`

---

## 📌 Common Pod Patterns
✅ **Single-container Pod**: Typical use case.  
✅ **Sidecar container**: Log shipper, monitoring agent.  
✅ **Ambassador container**: Proxy or API adapter.  
✅ **Adapter container**: Data transformation.

---

## 📌 Example Pod YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10

📌 Tips

✅ Pods are ephemeral — use Deployments or StatefulSets to manage at scale.
✅ Pods don’t self-heal on their own — higher-level controllers like Deployments manage their lifecycle.

# Kubernetes Pods — Complete Guide

## 📌 1. What is a Pod?
- **Smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
- Represents **one or more containers**:
  - Typically **one container per Pod**.
  - Multiple containers possible (sidecar, ambassador, adapter patterns).
- Containers in a Pod share:
  - **Network namespace** (same IP, port space).
  - **Volumes** (shared storage).

---

## 📌 2. Pod Basics — Key Points
✅ **Pods are ephemeral** (short-lived) — not intended for permanent workloads.  
✅ Managed by higher-level objects (Deployment, StatefulSet, Job) for replication, rollout, and self-healing.  
✅ **Pod Manifest** defines:
- Metadata (name, labels, annotations).
- Spec (containers, volumes, ports, probes, etc.).

---

## 📌 3. Pod Anatomy
### 🗂️ Pod Manifest Example
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

🔍 Key Fields

    metadata:

        name, labels, annotations.

    spec.containers:

        name, image, ports, resources, env, volumeMounts.

    spec.volumes: Storage for sharing data between containers.

    spec.restartPolicy: Always (default), OnFailure, Never.

    spec.nodeSelector, affinity, tolerations: Node placement.

📌 4. Pod Lifecycle
Phase	Description
Pending	Accepted by API Server but not yet scheduled.
Scheduled	Assigned to a node.
Running	Containers running on the node.
Succeeded	Completed successfully (exit code 0) — restartPolicy: Never.
Failed	Completed with failure (non-zero exit code).
Unknown	Node unreachable or status unknown.
📌 5. Pod Networking

✅ Each Pod gets a unique IP (via CNI plugin).
✅ Containers share the same IP and port space within the Pod.
✅ Communication:

    Pod-to-Pod: Direct IP or via Service.

    Pod-to-Service: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
    ✅ DNS provided by kube-dns or CoreDNS.

📌 6. Pod Storage

✅ Volumes allow data persistence and sharing between containers.
✅ Common volume types:

    emptyDir: ephemeral, node-local.

    hostPath: node’s filesystem (use with caution!).

    configMap & secret: inject configs and credentials.

    persistentVolumeClaim: dynamic or static storage.

📌 7. Multi-Container Pods

Use-cases:

    Sidecar: e.g. log collector.

    Ambassador: e.g. proxy.

    Adapter: e.g. data transformer.
    Containers share:

    Network namespace (same IP).

    Volumes.

📌 8. Pod Health Checks

    Liveness probe: Is the app alive? (restart on failure)

    Readiness probe: Is the app ready to accept traffic? (controls Service endpoint)

    Startup probe: For slow-starting apps.

📌 9. Pod Security

✅ Security Context: sets permissions.

    runAsUser, runAsGroup, fsGroup, privileged.
    ✅ Pod Security Policies (deprecated) → replaced by Pod Security Admission:

    Enforce security levels: privileged, baseline, restricted.

📌 10. Pod Labels & Selectors

✅ Labels:

metadata:
  labels:
    app: frontend

✅ Selectors:

    Used by Services, Deployments, ReplicaSets to select Pods.

📌 11. Pod Commands (kubectl)
Command	Description
kubectl get pods	List all pods
kubectl describe pod <name>	Detailed info
kubectl logs <pod>	View logs
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /bin/bash	Get shell inside pod
kubectl delete pod <name>	Delete pod
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml	Create/update pod
kubectl port-forward <pod> 8080:80	Forward local port to pod
📌 12. Pod Resource Management

    Requests: minimum guaranteed resources.

    Limits: maximum allowed resources.

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"

📌 13. Pod Scheduling

    NodeSelector: simple node affinity.

    Affinity/Anti-Affinity: advanced scheduling.

    Taints and Tolerations: avoid/accept nodes with taints.

📌 14. Advanced Topics

✅ Init Containers: run before main containers start.
✅ Ephemeral Containers: for debugging.
✅ PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs): control voluntary disruptions.
✅ Pod Overhead: track extra resources needed for Kubernetes management.
📌 15. Interview Tips — Pods

✅ Explain Pod vs Container: Pod = abstraction layer; contains container(s).
✅ Pod Lifecycle: Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed.
✅ Probes: Liveness vs Readiness vs Startup.
✅ Single vs Multi-Container Pods: Why/When?
✅ Networking: Pod IP allocation, DNS, CNI.
✅ Storage: emptyDir vs PVC.
✅ Resource Management: requests vs limits.
✅ Security: PodSecurityContext vs PodSecurityPolicy.
✅ Logging & Monitoring: logs, sidecars.
✅ Use-cases: Why ephemeral, why managed by Deployments.
✅ Horizontal Scaling: Pods are scaled by ReplicaSets/Deployments, not individually.
📌 16. YAML Cheat Sheet

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
  - name: sidecar-logger
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/app.log"]
  volumes:
  - name: shared-logs
    emptyDir: {}

📌 17. Best Practices

✅ Use Deployments to manage Pods, not standalone Pods.
✅ Define resource requests and limits to avoid node starvation.
✅ Implement health checks.
✅ Use labels and annotations consistently.
✅ Secure pods using Security Contexts and Network Policies.
